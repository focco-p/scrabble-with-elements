# Frequency Scrabble Calculator

This project calculates letter frequencies and their corresponding percentages for a given set of letter groups. It is designed to assist in analyzing letter distributions in various contexts, such as games or linguistic studies. I made this tool because I saw a video about creating scrabble out of elements.

## Files
- `calc.py`: Main script for calculating letter frequencies and percentages.
- `percent.py`: Contains functions for loading counts, converting to percentages, and saving results.
- `letter_groups.txt`: A list of letter groups used in calculations.
- `letter_group_counts.csv`: CSV file containing raw counts of letter groups.
- `letter_group_percentages.csv`: CSV file containing calculated percentages of letter groups.
- `word_frequencies.csv`: CSV file with word frequency data.

## Usage
1. Ensure all required files are in the same directory.
2. Run `calc.py` to perform calculations.
3. Run `percent.py` to perform further calculations.
4. Check the output in `letter_group_percentages.csv` for results.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
